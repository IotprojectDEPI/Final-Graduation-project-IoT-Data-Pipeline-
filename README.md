## Project Introduction

Aquaense is a project developed to support Egypt's 2030 Vision by providing a monitoring system for Egyptian fish farms.  

It can handle up to **11 tanks**, each with different species, and monitor up to **8 sensors per tank**.  

The system is also designed to be expandable, making it easy to add more tanks, sensors, and features in the future.
